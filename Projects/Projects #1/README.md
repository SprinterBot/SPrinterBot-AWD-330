# Project #1
## Experimenting with PID control, motor control, relay bridge (had no h-bridge)

**First Project**

Learn to control the brushed motor taken from the paper printer with stock encoder, and try to implement PID control using the central controller RPI Pico (no others currently available).

I will using an encoder 2 inches in diameter with 2,500 lines per revolution, precise! The motor is heavy but can be operated up to 45V, I am not really sure about the max amp. 
CAD Files are in Project 1 under the Projects section. And encoder details are in the Projects section. https://forum.arduino.cc/t/using-a-canon-printer-incremental-encoder-datasheet/1112039/9
All details, like what is PID control, and how it works, including closed loop and open loop control, remember chapters are just overviews.

Rotary brushed motor position control with PID worked succusfuly but encoder died, and had to move to Sewing Machine Singer Athena 2000 1970s linear servo motor, had to rebulid PID control, and I develped my own PID program.

10/25/2023
Project can be called finished, I have been succusf in building Servo motor with my own PID control, now I can move to next project.
