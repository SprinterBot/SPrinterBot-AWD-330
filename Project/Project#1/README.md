# Let's build a miniature model of a servo motor with precision position feedback loop control.
**Goal**:
-Learn stuff-learn everything about servo motors in detail


## Before we actually build a servo motor
**Servo motor, hmmm what is unique about servo motor, that stepper can't do**

**What are feedback loop and open loop control**

**What is PID**
