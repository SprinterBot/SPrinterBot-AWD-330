# Chapter 2

## Experimenting with PID control, motor control, relay bridge (had no h-bridge)
**First Project** 

Learn to control the brushed motor taken from the paper printer with stock encoder, and try to implement PID control using the main controller RPI Pico (no others currently available).

I will be using an encoder 2 inches in diameter that has 2,500 lines per revolution, precise! The motor is heavy but can be operated up to 45V, I am not really sure about the max amp power 
supply, but its max output is 500mA. I will have a closer look at this thread, https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/132720/how-do-i-find-the-voltage-range-for-an-unknown-dc-motor. 
CAD Files are in Project 1 under the Projects section. And encoder details more in the Projects section. https://forum.arduino.cc/t/using-a-canon-printer-incremental-encoder-datasheet/1112039/9
