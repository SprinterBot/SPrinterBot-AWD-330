# Chapter 2

## Experimenting with PID control, motor control, relay bridge (had no h-bridge)
**Project#1**
**First Project**


Learn to control the brushed motor taken from the paper printer with stock encoder, and try to implement PID control using the central controller RPI Pico (no others currently available).

I will use an encoder 2 inches in diameter with 2,500 lines per revolution, precise! The motor is heavy but can be operated up to 45V, I am not really sure about the max amp power 
supply, but its max output is 500mA. (I have an original paper printer power supply 45V 0.5A) I will have a closer look at this thread, https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/132720/how-do-i-find-the-voltage-range-for-an-unknown-dc-motor. 
CAD Files are in Project 1 under the Projects section. And encoder details more in the Projects section. https://forum.arduino.cc/t/using-a-canon-printer-incremental-encoder-datasheet/1112039/9
All details, like what is PID control, and how it works, including closed loop and open loop control, remember chapters are just overviews of the projects and the conclusion of the final results.
