# Chapter 2

## Experimenting with PID control, motor control, relay bridge (had no h-bridge)
**Project#1**
**First Project**


Learn to control the brushed motor taken from the paper printer with stock encoder, and try to implement PID control using the central controller RPI Pico (no others currently available).

I will using an encoder 2 inches in diameter with 2,500 lines per revolution, precise! The motor is heavy but can be operated up to 45V, I am not really sure about the max amp. 
CAD Files are in Project 1 under the Projects section. And encoder details are in the Projects section. https://forum.arduino.cc/t/using-a-canon-printer-incremental-encoder-datasheet/1112039/9
All details, like what is PID control, and how it works, including closed loop and open loop control, remember chapters are just overviews.
