# Quality-Speed-Printing-DIY-SERVOS-SprinterBot
Experimental project to build a 3D printer called **SprinterBot** Means Speed Printer Bot; with a DIY Linear Tubular DC Servo Motor. Introduce a new type of motor to the 3D printer community, more speed and better quality.

Goal: 
-Simplicity-DC Servo simpler over 3-phase brushless based.

-Linear motor-direct controller of linear movement.

-Strong and Fast

-DIY

-Cheap

-Diy Driver controller

-Cross gantry

-Lightweight

=Driver control from Mainsail

-Ironless (no cogging) smooth operation

# Short Project Description 

To achieve these goals it was considered that the current stepper motor + relatively cheap stepper driver are not enough or are too expensive to keep pushing boundaries of Speed and Acceleration while keeping considerably low cost. There are options to wait for manufacturers to engineer new drivers and motors that are relatively cheap and stronger while having low rotor inertia, like the new LDO Naema 17 stepper motor, most of us have seen the Legendary Vzbot by Vez with heavy liquid motor cooling to achieve a crazy speed of 3m/s, it is fast but on the small bed, it is almost impossible because stepper motor will require very high current which is directly proportional to torque where is more torque gives us higher acceleration. Another option is to get some industrial servos+driver like MirageC, or stepper+driver. Also, cheap servo+drives will be no better than the Naema 17 stepper motor. That's why it was considered to build a low-cost linear&actuator servo (DC) motor as a conventional DC motor is simpler in design and provides better toque and speed ratio, you should know that stepper motors are limited to speed and lose torque with speed while servo can provide more torque at speed. Why linear? Because it will be simpler and easier to build linear, than rotational, and the movement of the servo motor will directly affect the position of the print head, The most exciting part with a linear servo system, is there will be no belts: no stretching, tensioning, and I imagine this system should be super quite where's a stepper motor and silent driver with belt can't get rid of.

I'm not the first one who thought of a linear servo motor, many people thought of it; some German manufacturers make specialized linear servo motors but they are not popular YET. (Most of them are 3-phase not DC) For example, a DIY linear servo Project https://www.instructables.com/DIY-IRONLESS-LINEAR-SERVO-MOTOR/. I welcome you to my exploration of motors, how they work, how servo works, what is PID control, how it works, why cross gantry, power supplies, and drivers. There is a lot of science in just a simple DC motor. Check this out, this video will give an understanding of things you don't have understanding.

# Organization
There will be several chapters, which are sort of steps to reach the goal, They will explain the idea of the experiment and its results. Another section is the projects section which is made for the projects, it will deeply go over every part of the project, the CAD model, electronics, functionalities, each tool, and piece of code. CAD section is for all CAD models so you don't have to wounder around the documents to find the right part.
